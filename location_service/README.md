# Location Service

This service acts as an entrypoint for the car to the microservices. The car will send it's coordinates and this service will map the car's coordinates to the routemodel coordinates. Then this service will send a request containing the car's raw data and routemodel coordinates to the historical car/MongoDB service.

**TODO: API request from location service to historical car/MongoDB service**
