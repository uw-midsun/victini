Victini is real-time communication system between a client (car) and multiple microservices. It allows the client (car) to send real-time data to a server via an HTTP request, which will then process that data across multiple microservices and return meaningful/computed data via a websocket to the client.

## How to add your project

1. Create a new folder in the root of the repository for your project
2. Only work within that folder for your project
3. Add your project folder name + description in the "Table of Contents" section within this `README` file
4. Add a `README.md` file in your project's root folder documenting what the project is, how it works, how to use, etc. See the other project folders for examples
