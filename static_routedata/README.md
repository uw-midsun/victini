# Static Routedata

This folder will contain code that generates static route-related data that we will then seed into our database. It will be similar to RouteModel (for those who've worked with it) but **only contains static data**. Examples of static data include: direction, elevation, etc. Data such as weather, columb counting, etc. do not count as static data (as they are dynamic) and should be microservices.
